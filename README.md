# PeakFinder
This package is intended to identify known spectral signatures from multiple spectra of exoplanet atmospheres and produce them as results.
It is helpful to give a primary estimate of the lines present in a spectrum where the Signal-to-Noise ratio of the data can be user defined, without manual intervention.

## Outputs

1. A file called output.txt listing all the elements (or species) found in the spectra at which wavelength.
2. A file called statistics_output.tt listing the results from our fitting exxercise on the significant peaks in th signal.
3. A set of plots concerning the spectra and the identified peaks.
